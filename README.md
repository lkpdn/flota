# flota (wip)

* personal infrastructure CI tool

* tasks such as:
  * setting up OS, middlewares and applications for each environment (dev, test, staging, production, etc.)
  * testing the whole cluster works fine as expected
  * applying changes on some configurations for each environment and again, test them
* are all tedious while great care must be taken to prevent severe incidents.
